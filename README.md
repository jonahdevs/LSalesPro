# API Authentication
## Authentication and Users
All API routes (except login / register) are protected using **Laravel Sanctum**

### To Authenticate
   ** You can import this [Postman Collection](./postman/Authentication.postman_collection.json) to test the API endpoints

1. Send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with email and password
  -- for testing use 'admin@example.com' as email and 'password' as password
2. You'll receive a token in the response
    ```
    {
    "success": "",
    "message": "",
    "data": {
        "user": {},
        "token": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
    ```
3. Include this token  in the `Authorization' header
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer your_access_toke
    ```
    NOTE:: All subsequest requests must include this toke

    - In Authentication you can perform actions such as refresh token, login, logout, forgot password and password reset.
    - All the authetication routes start with api/auth
     * /api/auth/login
     * /api/auth/logout
     * /api/auth/refresh
     * /api/auth/user
